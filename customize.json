Every conversation, every laugh, and even the quiet moments, and everything in between have made me realize how truly special the connection, that we share is. I’m so grateful that we crossed paths when we did, and I’m excited to keep learning more about you—your quirks, dreams, little silly thoughts, and all the little things that make you *YOU*. Today’s just a small excuse to remind you how much joy and light you’ve already brought into my world. I don’t know what the future holds for us, but I'm damm sure that I’m so, excited to discover it with you. Anyway, let's not think about tomorrow, Here’s to today! Celebrating us… 🥰🥂 You are someone I just can't stop thinking about, Thank you for being *exactly* who you are. I love you so much! More than I ever can put it into my words! 🫂💗",
